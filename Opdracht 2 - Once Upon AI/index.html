                <h2>Chapter 1: The Magic Potion</h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a poor farmer named Jack. One day, he stumbled upon a hidden potion in the forest, which promised to turn any animal into a dancing sensation. Jack decided to try the potion on his old donkey, hoping to win a prize at the local fair. Little did he know that the potion had some unexpected side effects.

                <p>
                    As soon as Jack gave the potion to the donkey, it started to dance uncontrollably. The donkey's hooves tapped and twirled, and its tail swayed to the rhythm of an invisible beat. The people of the village were amazed to see a donkey dance like a professional ballerina. Jack was overjoyed, thinking he would win the grand prize. But the donkey had other plans.

                <p>
                    The donkey escaped from Jack's farm and started to dance its way through the village. The villagers were amused at first, but soon the donkey's wild dance moves started to cause chaos. It danced over people's gardens, knocking over flower pots, and it even danced on a wedding cake, ruining the entire ceremony. The villagers were furious and demanded that Jack take back his dancing donkey.

                    Jack realized that he needed to do something to stop the dancing donkey. He consulted the wise old wizard, who suggested that they needed to find the antidote to the potion. They searched the forest, and after hours of searching, they found the antidote. Jack poured it into the donkey's water trough, hoping it would stop the dancing.

                <p>
                    As soon as the donkey drank the antidote, it stopped dancing and fell into a deep sleep. The villagers were relieved that the dancing donkey was finally gone, but Jack was sad to see it go. However, the next day, the donkey woke up and started to bray happily. It was no longer dancing, but it had learned some new tricks, like juggling apples and doing cartwheels. The villagers were amazed, and they declared the donkey the winner of the grand prize. Jack was overjoyed, and he and the donkey lived happily ever after.
